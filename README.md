# StandAAArdise

Hello! If you found this repository, you are probably looking for a way to standardize your projects, and that's a good thing!

This repository does nothing. Literally nothing. It's a place where you can find the project I used to prepare my talk about the AAA pattern.

## What is the AAA pattern?

Well, all the answers can be found in the [slides](./slides/standaaardise-your-tests.pptx) of my talk! (todo: add url when the video is out).

## How to use this repository?

I used this repository for a demo for this talk!

The idea is to explain how we could standardize our tests.
A part of it is to use the same language: using the same vocabulary to talk about the same things, does Unit test mean the same to you and me?
Also use the same logic to write our test in a similar way. And that's when the pattern AAA comes to mind.

Even though the pattern seems strict, you can add a bit of flexibility to what you write, for example when expecting exceptions with PHPUnit (see `BookDinosaurTest::it_throws_an_exception_when_booking_in_the_past`).

If you want to play with the AAA pattern, you can rewrite any part of this app. Or even be crazy and add things up.

### Install

```bash
./bin/composer install
```

### Run tests

```bash
./bin/phpunit
```

You can look at the tests in the [tests](./tests) directory.
